## What is this?
This project's purpose was to practice working with time in JavaScript. A Clock with JavaScript animation that shows actual time. Also, some nice one-div snow from @KeithClark pen. Flare effect for now doesn't work in Edge. JS implementation taken from Wes Bos challenge. Contains cool mixin to generate circular numbers and interesting technique to create shadows for them. 
You can play around and experiment with it on CodePen.
